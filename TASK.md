I have a list of astrological events (like, aspects or retrograde/direct movements), that was a basis for astro calendar widget for WordPress website. To make this list I used NASA data (de442.bsp) and python script to calculate all those events.

The plan is to create a visual representation of this event list. So, as a result, I want to show user a minute-interval timeline of schematic Solar System (it should look good, but no real need for 3D) with controls and depiction of all those events. If there is an aspect between two planets, we should show it to user explicitely in the form of lines + angle + symbol. If the planet stops (visuall from Earth) and starts moving in the opposite direction, we should note it for user somehow. The same with every event from the list.

The 1st step of the plan is to decide on tools. What stack should be used to 1) process all data; 2) display it for user. There is no requirements to use the same stack for both. The things to consider:
- performance (it should reasonably quickly render Solar System model during timeline manipulations)
- environment (Wordpress website)
- general solution (both parts, calculations and rendering, should be modular and scalable)
- simplicity + visual appeal (rendering should be performative and simplified, but the ultimate goal is good and memorable visualization, so it's a very important part of the task)

The 2nd step is to create a development plans (one simplified, with general steps, and second is detailed, with granular tactical split) based on first step choices. Both will be kept in PLAN.md and should be updated after any significant changes along with actual file structure of the project.

The 3rd step is to prepare all the neccessary files and structure for the project, including .md files, .gitignore, .aiexclude, dependencies, virtual environment (if neccessary), etc

The 4th step is Github project creation; initial commit + push; creating a branch for calculating module dev and switching to it

The 5th step is calculating module development and testing

6th - merging to main, creating a branch for rendering module dev and switching to it

7th - rendering module development and testing

8th - merging to main

9th - optimization/refactoring if neccessary

10th - deployment
